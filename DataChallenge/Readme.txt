This is a work sample of data analysis. It includes data loading, data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, merging different datasets, 
preprocessing, use of Fb Prophet for predicting data from time series data and  finally analysis and conclusion.


1)
The folder contains the following files:
DataChallenge.html
DataChallenge.pynb
DataChallenge.pdf
DataChallenge.py
Requirements.txt
functions.py


2)
The user is suggensted to use the OneDataChallenge.html to view the analysis as the html file 
supports the graphs as well which is not supported in the pdf file. 
The DataChallenge.pynb is well documented and contains all the import commands for the code to
run smoothly. The user is requested to import the modules as it is in the DataChallenge.py or
DataChallenge.pynb file.

3)
The users is requested to copy and save the functions.py file in the same directory as the python (.py) file
 or Jupyter notebook (.pynb) file so that the functions.py module can be imported succesfully.


4)
The notebook uses various functions under the module functions.py so the user should import functions modules as:
>> import functions


5)
functions.py contains all the functions used in the code which is well documented for the puspose of 
reusability and contains user help as well.

User can get the help function on the functions module for comments after  importing the module by:
>> help(functions)


6)
User is requested to use the requirements.txt file to install any dependencies so that the codes will run well.
User can use the following command:

>> pip install -r requirements.txt


7) 
User is requested to be patient while the prophet forecating model runs as it may take few minutes depending 
upon the specification of the user's computer
